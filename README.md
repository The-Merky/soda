# A Machine Learning Library
with a focus on simplicity.


## Warning
This project is currently on for my personal learning. If you wish to mess around with neural networks using a simple syntax and clear documentation while still being efficient, soda aims just to be that. Check back here in a few weeks to see how the project is going! I try to commit at least once every day with a commit being a feature or a fatal bug fix. I am also not the best at Rust, so please point out any banal mistakes! My Goal: be able to build out a simple neural net to classify images form the MNIST database with relatively high accuracy
